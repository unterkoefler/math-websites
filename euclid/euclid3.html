        <h1>Congratulations! You Got the Legendary Proposition 47!</h1>
        <p>Our algorithm determined that you, like Proposition 47, are very strong-willed and intelligent. Both you and Proposition 47 like to get things done and fix problems in your respective communities. Proposition 47 proves the world-famous Pythagorean theorem: in a right triangle, a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>, where a and b are the lengths of the legs of the triangle, and c is the length of the longest side, the hypotenuse, of the triangle. Euclid put it nicely: "In right-angled triangles the square on the side opposite the right angle equals the sum of the squares on the sides containing the right angle."</p><br>

        <p>The proof of this proposition relies on a few simple principles: proving the congruence of triangles and relating the areas of these triangles to those of rectangles and squares. Proposition 47 is very influential, just like you, and is heavily used in various proofs across many branches of mathematics. It doesn't stop there, however, and is regularly used in fields such as science and engineering. Who knows where we would be today without proposition 47? Or without you! Thank Euclid we do have it!</p><br><br>
