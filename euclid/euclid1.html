        <h1>Congratulations! You Got Proposition 32!</h1>
        <p>Based on our algorithm, you have an intricate personality and refined tastes. Just like you, Proposition 32 is complex and enjoys tasting fine wine. Proposition 32 proves that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees or in Euclid's eloquent words, "In any triangle, if one of the sides is produced, then the exterior angle equals the sum of the two interior and opposite angles, and the sum of the three interior angles of the triangle equals two right angles." Wow! So intricate! So refined!</p><br>
        <p>Proposition 32 is an extension of Proposition 16, which proves that the measure of the exterior angle of a triangle is greater than that of either of the two opposite interior angles. Or, in the diagram, Angle ACD is greater than Angle ABC and is also greater than Angle CAB!</p><br><br>

        <p>Proposition 32, however, proves that the exterior angle ACD is actually equal to the sum of Angles ABC and CAB! Proposition 32 is kind of like Proposition 16's daughter, and like you, she has surpassed her parents in every way. Proposition 32 also has "daughters" of its own: Corallaries 1 and 2, which extend the idea about the sum of angles in a triangle to other shapes with more sides.</p><br>

        <p>Also of interest about Proposition 32 is that in it Euclid does not use the concept of degrees. Instead of saying that the angles add up to 180 &#176;, Euclid uses the term "the sum of two right angles." Euclid is much too couth and refined to use degrees.</p><br><br>
