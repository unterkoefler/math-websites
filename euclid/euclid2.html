        <h1>Congrats! You got Proposition 4!</h1>
        
        <p>Based on your answers, our algorithm determined you have a fun-loving personality. Just like you, Proposition 4 loves to have fun. It is commonly known as the Side-Angle-Side Congruence Theorem, or as Euclid called it, "If two triangles have two sides equal to two sides respectively, and have the angles contained by the equal straight lines equal, then they also have the base equal to the base, the triangle equals the triangle, and the remaining angles equal the remaining angles respectively, namely those opposite the equal sides."</p><br>
        
        <p>Like you, Propostion 4 seems complicated and confusing at first glance, but if you pay close attention and follow each step carefully, Propostion 4, just like you, is logically sound and based on a few simple principles. Unlike other propositions, the proof for number 4 relies only on Common Notion 4 - things which coincide with one another are equal!</p><br>

        <p>You and Proposition 4 also share something else very important! Remember back in geometry class when you had to draw those congruence symbols? Remember how you always wanted to just use an equals sign? Remember how your geometry teacher gave you an F for saying Triangle ABC = Triangle DEF? Well Euclid felt the same way as you about congruence! In Proposition 4 (and the rest of Book I) Euclid simply says that the triangles are equal, not congruent!</p><br><br>
