				<li>If you are on a rocket ship, can you determine how fast you are
					going by measuring the speed of light?</li>
				<input type="radio" name="q1" value="Y"> Yes, of course!<br> 
				<input type="radio" name="q1" value="N"> No, the speed of light isconstant!<br> 
				<li>Can you move faster than the speed of light?</li>
				<input type="radio" name="q2" value="Y"> Only with a flux capacitor.<br> 
				<input type="radio" name="q2" value="N"> No! That would mean we would have to take the square root of a negative number in the Lorentz Transformation.<br> 
				<li>If you are chilling in the lab with Einstein, observing his evil twin Alberto time events in his really fast rocket ship, who will measure longer times?</li>
				<input type="radio" name="q3" value="Alberto">Alberto. In his reference frame, light has a shorter distance to travel because Alberto observes no &Delta;x'. To travel a shorter distance at the same speed, it must happen more slowly.<br> 
				<input type="radio" name="q3" value="You"> You do. Duh!<br> 
				<li>Where did Einstein work when he was conjuring up his crazy brilliant thought experiments?</li>
                <input type="radio" name="q4" value="Patent"> At the Patent Office<br> 
				<input type="radio" name="q4" value="Space"> Uhh...in a rocket ship?<br> 
				<li>If Alberto is traveling at .9c m/s in his rocket ship and witnesses a ball roll 3 m to his right in a time of 1.5 s, what does Albert, watching the ball roll from outside the rocket ship see?</li>
				<input type="radio" name="q5" value="a"> The ball roll 9.98 m in 9.63 seconds<br> 
				<input type="radio" name="q5" value="b"> The ball roll 3 m in 1.5 s. Nothing is relative!<br>
